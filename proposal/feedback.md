This is a really solid and clear proposal — you explain the problem well and the dataset choice makes total sense for what you want to do. I like that you connected it to DeepLog and LogAnomaly, that shows you’ve already thought about how this fits into existing work. Only small stuff (add in your final report/work maybe?): it’d help to be a bit more specific about what models you actually plan to try (right now it’s kinda broad), and maybe say a sentence about how you’ll parse/clean the logs since that part can get messy in practice, e.g., are you using existing tokenizers or how are you trasnforming them into ML-digestable formats. Also maybe think about what metrics you’ll focus on beyond just accuracy, since anomalies are super imbalanced. But overall this looks good and pretty doable.
